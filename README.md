## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
```bash
# System requirements
- Python 3.8+
- CUDA compatible GPU (optional)
- 8GB+ RAM recommended

# Primary dependencies
- PyTorch 2.0+
- FastAPI
- websockets
- pydantic
```

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/praecise/thecortex.git
cd cortex

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install development dependencies (optional)
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

### Basic Configuration

Create a configuration file `config.yaml`:

```yaml
network:
  websocket_url: "ws://localhost:8765"
  node_id: "local_node_1"
  retry_attempts: 3
  connection_timeout: 30

training:
  input_dim: 784
  hidden_dims: [512, 256]
  output_dim: 10
  batch_size: 32
  learning_rate: 0.001
  max_epochs: 100

security:
  enable_encryption: true
  encryption_key: null  # Auto-generated if not provided

monitoring:
  log_level: "INFO"
  metrics_port: 9090
  enable_prometheus: true
```

### Running a Training Node

```python
from cortex.integration.manager import CortexManager

async def main():
    # Initialize manager
    manager = CortexManager("config.yaml")
    await manager.initialize()
    
    # Start training
    await manager.start_training(dataloader)
```

## Development

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest tests/

# Run specific test suite
pytest tests/test_network.py

# Run with coverage report
pytest --cov=cortex tests/
```

### Code Style
- Follow PEP 8 guidelines
- Use type hints for function arguments and returns
- Document classes and complex functions
- Run black for code formatting
